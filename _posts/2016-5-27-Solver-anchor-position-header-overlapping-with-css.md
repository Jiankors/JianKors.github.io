Compile Caffe with Visual Studio 2013 on Windows 7 x64, using Cuda 7.0, boost 1.57.0, OpenCV 2.4.11 and OpenBlas 0.2.14.  

After succesfully build, you will get tools like *caffe.exe* and examples  like *convert_mnist_data.exe* under path *bin*, which can be used for Train-and-Test on the dataset *mnist*.
